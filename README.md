# ZephyrHub

ZephyrHub is a simple four port USB 2.0 Hub designed for the [Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com), a 10-day hackathon where hack clubbers went across the country from HC HQ in Shelburne VT to SpaceX in LA.

The board is modeled off the Superdome, one of the train cars chartered for the journey. It allows for a reversible USB2/3 Type C cable in, and outputs four USB2 Type A ports.

The design files, schematic, and BOM/ordering info are available in this repo. Files were designed in KiCAD v5 and are forward-compatible to KiCAD v6+. An image of the schematic and a .zip of the gerbers are also provided.
